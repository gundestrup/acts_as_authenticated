I have salved the source code from technoweenie + wiki for future referance.

This is a basic authentication generator for rails, very much in the spirit of xal's original Login Generator.

To use:
1) Install the plugin
  ./ruby script/plugin install git://github.com/gundestrup/acts_as_authenticated.git
2) create the model + controller
  ./script/generate authenticated user account

This generates a basic user model, a controller, some basic views, and tests.  Extra functionality can be unlocked by
removing the comments for them.  I have a few examples such as user activation and reversible encrypted passwords.

The user migration is also generated unless you pass --skip-migration.

Generate your mailer:

  ./script/generate authenticated_mailer user
